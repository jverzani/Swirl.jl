Learn `Julia` interactively in your console/terminal, inspired by the [swirl](https://swirlstats.com/) library for `R`!

## Overview

`Swirl.jl` is an interactive learning platform that teaches you `Julia` programming right in your `REPL` (Read-Eval-Print Loop). Work through lessons at your own pace, get instant feedback on your answers, and build your `Julia` skills step by step.

📺 **[Watch a demo video](https://youtu.be/_gOWw0_fi-E)** to see Swirl in action!

After trying it out, feel free to give it a ⭐ on GitHub!

============================================================
Learn basic arithmetic operations and how to create bindings in Julia.

--- Question 1 of 7 ---

Welcome to Swirl for Julia! In this lesson, you'll learn the basics of
Julia programming. We'll start with simple math operations and bindings.

Let's begin! Julia can be used as a calculator. Try adding 5 + 3.

swirl> 5 + 3
✓ Correct!

--- Question 2 of 7 ---

Great! Now try multiplication. What is 7 * 6?

swirl> hint
💡 Hint: In Julia, multiplication uses the asterisk symbol: *
Type: 7 * 6
(Note: Unlike some languages, you can't skip the * symbol, so '7 6' won't work)

swirl> 7 * 6
✓ Correct!

...
```

> **Note:** The example above shows REPL mode (with ReplMaker.jl installed). The prompt changes to `swirl>` and you get syntax highlighting. Without ReplMaker, you'll use classic mode with the standard `julia>` prompt.

## 🎓 Installing Custom Courses

### From a Local Directory

```julia
# Your course directory should contain a course.jl file
install_course("/path/to/my_course")
```

### From GitHub

```julia
# Install directly from a GitHub repository
install_course("https://github.com/atantos/course-repo")
```

### From a URL

```julia
# Install from a .zip or .tar.gz archive
install_course("https://example.com/course.zip")
```

> **Note:** Installing from GitHub or URLs requires system commands to be available:
>
> - `unzip` for .zip files (GitHub repos and .zip archives)
> - `tar` for .tar.gz files
>
> These are typically pre-installed on Linux/macOS. On Windows, you may need Git Bash, WSL, or manual extraction.

### Example

```bash
# 1. Create a course directory
mkdir ~/my_julia_course

# 2. Copy the template
cp templates/course/course.jl ~/my_julia_course/

# 3. Edit it with your content
# Edit ~/my_julia_course/course.jl
```

```julia
# 4. Install it
using Swirl
install_course(expanduser("~/my_julia_course"))

# 5. Use it!
swirl()
```

## 📝 Creating Custom Courses

### Quick Start

1. **Use the template:**

   ```bash
   cp templates/course/course.jl ~/my_course/
   ```

2. **Edit the course:**

   ```julia
   Course(
       "My Awesome Course",
       "Description of what students will learn",
       [
           Lesson("Lesson 1", "Description", [
               Question("Welcome!", :message, nothing),
               Question("Calculate 1+1", :code, 2, "Type: 1+1"),
               # ... more questions
           ]),
           # ... more lessons
       ]
   )
   ```

3. **Install and test:**
   ```julia
   install_course(expanduser("~/my_course"))
   swirl()
   ```

### Question Types

**Message (Information Only):**

```julia
Question("Welcome to this lesson!", :message, nothing)
```

**Code Execution:**

```julia
Question(
    "Calculate 2 + 2",
    :code,
    4,              # Expected result
    "Type: 2 + 2"   # Hint
)
```

**Multiple Choice:**

```julia
# Helper function (recommended)
mc(q, choices, correct_idx, hint="") =
    Question(q, :multiple_choice, correct_idx, hint, choices, nothing)

mc(
    "What is Julia?",
    ["A programming language", "A person", "A city"],
    1,              # Correct answer (1-based indexing)
    "It's for programming!"
)

# Or use the full constructor directly:
Question(
    "What operator is used for exponentiation?",
    :multiple_choice,
    3,                      # Index of correct answer
    "It's the ^ symbol",    # Hint
    ["*", "**", "^", "pow"], # Choices array
    nothing                 # Validator (usually nothing)
)
```

**Multi-Step Code:**

```julia
Question(
    "Create x = 5, then calculate x * 2",
    :code,
    10,                    # Final result
    "Type: x = 5; x * 2"   # Hint
)
```

## 💾 How It Works

### Code Evaluation

`Swirl.jl` evaluates your `Julia` code in real-time using the `Main` module, so:

- ✅ Bindings you create persist between questions
- ✅ You can use any `Julia` feature
- ✅ Your code runs in the same environment as your `REPL`
- ✅ Multi-step questions work naturally

### Data Storage

```
~/.swirl_julia/
├── courses/          # Installed custom courses
│   ├── Course1/
│   └── Course2/
└── progress/         # Your saved progress
    └── *.progress
```

Progress is automatically saved:

- After each correct answer
- When you exit a lesson
- When you navigate back to menus

## 💾 How It Works

**Q: Where is my progress saved?**  
A: Progress is saved in `~/.swirl_julia/progress/` in your home directory. It's automatically saved after each question.

**Q: Can I restart a completed lesson?**  
A: Yes! You can either:

- Select the lesson and choose "yes" when asked to restart
- Type `reset 1` at the lesson menu to reset lesson 1

**Q: Will typing 'exit' close my `Julia` session?**  
A: No! The `exit` command returns you to the `Julia` `REPL`. Your session continues and all bindings remain available.

**Q: What if I make a mistake?**  
A: You get 3 attempts per question, and you can always type `hint` for detailed help!

**Q: Can I share my custom course?**  
A: Yes! Push it to `GitHub` and others can install it with:

```julia
install_course("https://github.com/username/your-course")
```

**Q: How do I uninstall a course?**  
A: Use `uninstall_course("Course Name")`. Note: Built-in courses like **`Julia` Basics** cannot be uninstalled.

**Q: Can I modify an installed course?**  
A: Yes! User-installed courses are stored as files in `~/.swirl_julia/courses/` and can be edited directly.
