--- Question 1 of 7 ---

Welcome to Swirl for Julia! Let's begin! Julia can be used as a 
calculator. Try adding 5 + 3.

julia> 5 + 3
8
✓ Correct!

--- Question 2 of 7 ---

Great! Now try multiplication. What is 7 * 6?

julia> hint
💡 Hint: In Julia, multiplication uses the asterisk symbol: *
Type: 7 * 6
(Note: Unlike some languages, you can't skip the * symbol, so '7 6' won't work)

julia> 7 * 6
42
✓ Correct!

...
```

   ```bash
   cp templates/course/course.jl ~/my_course/
   ```

2. **Edit the course:**
   ```julia
   Course(
       "My Awesome Course",
       "Description of what students will learn",
       [
           Lesson("Lesson 1", "Description", [
               Question("Welcome!", :message, nothing),
               Question("Calculate 1+1", :code, 2, "Type: 1+1"),
               # ... more questions
           ]),
           # ... more lessons
       ]
   )
   ```

3. **Install and test:**
   ```julia
   install_course(expanduser("~/my_course"))
   swirl()
   ```

### Question Types

**Message (Information Only):**
```julia
Question("Welcome to this lesson!", :message, nothing)
```

**Code Execution:**
```julia
Question(
    "Calculate 2 + 2",
    :code,
    4,              # Expected result
    "Type: 2 + 2"   # Hint
)
```

**Multiple Choice:**
```julia
mc(q, choices, correct_idx, hint="") = 
    Question(q, :multiple_choice, correct_idx, hint, choices)

mc(
    "What is Julia?",
    ["A programming language", "A person", "A city"],
    1,              # Correct answer (1-based indexing)
    "It's for programming!"
)
```

**Multi-Step Code:**
```julia
Question(
    "Create x = 5, then calculate x * 2",
    :code,
    10,                    # Final result
    "Type: x = 5; x * 2"   # Hint
)
```

## 💾 How It Works

### Code Evaluation

Swirl.jl evaluates your Julia code in real-time using the `Main` module, so:
- ✅ Variables you create persist between questions
- ✅ You can use any Julia feature or package
- ✅ Your code runs in the same environment as your REPL
- ✅ Multi-step questions work naturally

### Data Storage

```
~/.swirl_julia/
├── courses/          # Installed custom courses
│   ├── Course1/
│   └── Course2/
└── progress/         # Your saved progress
    └── *.progress
```

Progress is automatically saved:
- After each correct answer
- When you exit a lesson
- When you navigate back to menus

## 💾 How It Works

**Q: Where is my progress saved?**  
A: Progress is saved in `~/.swirl_julia/progress/` in your home directory. It's automatically saved after each question.

**Q: Can I restart a completed lesson?**  
A: Yes! You can either:
- Select the lesson and choose "yes" when asked to restart
- Type `reset 1` at the lesson menu to reset lesson 1
- Use `reset_lesson_progress("Course", "Lesson")` from Julia

**Q: Will typing 'exit' close my Julia session?**  
A: No! The `exit` command returns you to the Julia REPL. Your session continues and all variables remain available.

**Q: What if I make a mistake?**  
A: You get 3 attempts per question, and you can always type `hint` for detailed help!

**Q: Can I share my custom course?**  
A: Yes! Push it to GitHub and others can install it with:
```julia
install_course("https://github.com/username/your-course")
```

**Q: How do I uninstall a course?**  
A: Use `uninstall_course("Course Name")`. Note: Built-in courses like "Julia Basics" cannot be uninstalled.

**Q: Can I modify an installed course?**  
A: Yes! User-installed courses are stored as files in `~/.swirl_julia/courses/` and can be edited directly.
